 Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
 General Public License cover the whole combination.
</pre> 
 
<p>The header file 'avisynth.h' (included with the FilterSDK or any other package) 
is distributed under a special exception of GPL license:</p>

<pre>
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
 permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate with
 Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h, regardless of the license
 terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
 resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
 every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
 the source code of Avisynth (the version of Avisynth used to produce the
 combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU General
 Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
 which is not derived from or based on Avisynth, such as 3rd-party filters,
 import and export plugins, or graphical user interfaces.
</pre>


<p>It seems, this 'avisynth.h' license exception also covers most parts of source code examples in this SDK documentation.
See <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=32863">[discussion.]</a>

So, if you do not use any other AviSynth source code parts or source code of some other GPL plugin, 
then you may distribute your plugin as either open or close source program.
</p>
 
<p>Note: SimpleSample plugin for Avisynth is Copyright (C) 2002-2003 Simon Walters and distributed under GNU GPL license.</p> 

<p>The goal is to encourage others to contribute to the open source community, 
the exception clause is to allow authors to choose the licence terms for their work, 
hopefully they do the community spirited thing and release their source code.</p>
